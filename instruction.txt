Cypress

Now I'll create Cypress tests for this Django-based GIS system. First, let's install Cypress and set up the testing environment:
Run in terminal
npm init -y
Terminal Output

Now let's install Cypress:
Run in terminal
npm install cypress --save-dev
Terminal Output

Let's also install the Cypress Django plugin for better integration:
Run in terminal
Exit Code: 1
npm install @cypress/django --save-dev
Terminal Output

That plugin doesn't exist. Let's create the Cypress configuration and directory structure:
Run in terminal
npx cypress open
Terminal Output

Cd
npx cypress run --record --key <record-key>
